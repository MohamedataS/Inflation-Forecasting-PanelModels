# **1. Introduction and Review**

**Panel data (longitudinal or cross-sectional time-series data):**
    that combines temporal depth with cross-sectional breadth, offering a powerful framework that enhances the precision and richness of econometric inference (Hsiao, 2003).

**The evolution of panel methodologies began in the mid-20th century when researchers recognized the limitations of using only cross-sectional or time-series data:**
- Verbeek & Nijman (1992) and Moulton (1990) introduce fixed/random-effects and temporal-dependency models.
- Arellano & Bond (1991) develop dynamic GMM estimators to address endogeneity.

**Panel data methods offer several crucial advantages over purely cross-sectional or time-series analyses:**
- Controls unobservables: Fixed/Random Effects capture time-invariant factors (e.g., institutions, culture) (Baltagi, 2008). For example, Fischer (1993) showed how inflation behaves differently under various policy regimes (inflation inertia).
- Improved efficiency: Pooling over time increases sample size, reducing variance inflation (Wooldridge, 2010).
- Captures dynamics: Lagged variables model persistence in macro indicators (Arellano & Bond, 1991).

---

# **2. Study Objectives**

- **Compare Panel:** Evaluate Pooled OLS, Fixed Effects, Random Effects, and Dynamic GMM models‚Äîassessing their performance via diagnostic tests (e.g., Hausman, AR(2), Sargan).
- **Empirical Application:** Use a balanced panel (1980‚Äì2024) of annual macroeconomic indicators for 77 countries‚Äîboth developed and developing‚Äîto analyze and forecast inflation dynamics.
- **Recommendations:** Formulate clear recommendations for selecting the most appropriate panel data technique based on data characteristics and diagnostic outcomes.

---

# **3. Dataset Overview**

The dataset includes annual data for 77 countries from 1980 to 2024, sourced from the IMF‚Äôs World Economic Outlook (WEO).

The target variable is PCPIPCH (Inflation, average consumer prices).

**Explanatory variables used are:**
`Public Finance:`
- `GGSB_NPGDP`: General government structural balance (% of GDP).
- `GGXWDG_NGDP`: General government gross debt (% of GDP).
`Economic Output, Productivity & PPP:`
- `PPPPC`: GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity (international dollars).
`International Trade & Balance:`
- `TX_RPCH`: Volume of exports of goods and services (% change).
- `TM_RPCH`: Volume of imports of goods and services (% change).
`Savings & Investment:`
- `NID_NGDP`: Total investment (% of GDP).

# **4. Preprocessing**

## **4.1 Missing Values (MICE-BR)**

**Iterative Imputation with Bayesian Ridge (MICE-BR):**

- Treats each missing variable as a regression on the other observed variables within a Bayesian framework.
- Applied separately for each country to preserve country-specific heterogeneity.
- Imputes missing values without discarding the rich relationships among variables.

![Dashboard (Egypt) Before](/07-Report/Dash_EG_N.png)
![Dashboard (US) Before](/07-Report/Dash_US_N.png)

`**Python Code:**`
```python
# Handle missing values for each country 
def handle_missing_country(country):
    imputer = IterativeImputer(estimator=BayesianRidge(), max_iter=20, random_state=0, verbose=2)
    country[cols_with_na] = imputer.fit_transform(country[cols_with_na])
    return country
# Apply the imputation process by country
df_interpolated = df_panel_b.groupby('Country', group_keys=False).apply(handle_missing_country)
```

# **5. Panel Data Models**

`Pooled OLS:` Ignores both country-specific and time-specific heterogeneity.

`Fixed Effects (FE):` Assumes country effects are time-invariant, country-specific characteristics (intercept for each country).

`Random Effects (RE):` Assumes country effects are randomly distributed (treated as random parameters).

**Two-Step Difference GMM (Arellano‚ÄìBond):**

- Addresses endogeneity using internal instruments (e.g., past values).
- Adds lagged dependent variables to model persistence over time.
- Suitable for panels with many countries (N) and a few years (T) (N‚â´T).
- Robust to autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity with proper diagnostics.

---

## **5.1 (POLS), (FE), and(RE)**

`The Pooled OLS model` explains approximately 45% of the variation in inflation rates across the sample, as indicated by the R-squared value of 0.4525. 
The overall model is statistically significant (F = 454.25, p < 0.001), suggesting that the selected regressors jointly explain inflation variation across countries and time.

`The Fixed Effects model` explains approximately 46.9% of the within-country variation in inflation, as indicated by the R-squared value.
The model is statistically significant overall (F = 535.95, p < 0.001), confirming that the selected regressors jointly explain meaningful within-country variation in inflation rates.

`The Random Effects model` explains approximately 46.5% of the variation in inflation across countries and over time. 
The model is statistically significant overall (œá¬≤ = 3,262.87, p < 0.001), indicating strong joint explanatory power of the selected regressors.

## **5.2.A. Wald test: Pooled OLS vs Fixed Effects** 

- `ùëØ_ùüé`: All individual (country) effects are jointly equal to zero ‚Üí Pooled OLS is sufficient.
- `ùëØ_ùüè`: At least one individual effect is non-zero ‚Üí Fixed Effects model is preferred.

**Results:** F-statistic = 9.48 (p-value = 0.0021).

**Decision:** Since the p-value < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.

**Conclusion:** The test confirms that individual (country-specific) effects are statistically significant, and therefore, the Fixed Effects model is preferred over Pooled OLS. 

## **5.2.B. Hausman Test: Fixed Effects vs Random Effects**

- `ùëØ_ùüé`: Random Effects model is consistent and efficient.
- `ùëØ_ùüè`: Random Effects model is inconsistent

**Results:** Chi-squared = 2.58 (p-value = 0.8597)

**Decision:** Since the p-value > 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

**Conclusion:** There is no statistical evidence of correlation between the country-specific effects and the regressors, implying that the Random Effects model is consistent and preferred over the Fixed Effects model in this case.

## **5.3.A. Diagnostic Testing and Model Validity Assessment**

**Key Assumptions of the Random Effects Model:**

**A) No heteroskedasticity (Breusch‚ÄìPagan and White Test):**
- `ùëØ_ùüé`: Homoskedasticity (constant variance). 
- `ùëØ_ùüè`: Presence of heteroskedasticity.

**Breusch‚ÄìPagan Test:** Statistic = 13.62 (p-value = 0.0182)

**White Test:** Statistic = 18.01 (p-value = 0.0062)

**Decision:** Since both p-values are below 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis of homoskedasticity.

**B) No autocorrelation (Breusch‚ÄìGodfrey Test):**
- `ùëØ_ùüé`: No serial correlation.
- `ùëØ_ùüè`: Serial correlation exists.

**Results:** Chi-squared = 751.38, p-value < 2.2e-16

**Decision:** With a p-value near zero, we reject the null hypothesis of no serial correlation in the residuals.

## **5.3.B. Diagnostic Testing and Model Validity Assessment**

**C) Pesaran‚Äôs Cross-sectional Dependence (CD) Test:**
- `ùëØ_ùüé`: Cross-sectional independence. 
- `ùëØ_ùüè`: Cross-sectional dependence.

**Results:** z-statistic = 22.65 (p-value < 2.2e-16)

**Decision:** Reject the null hypothesis significant cross-sectional dependence exists.

**D) Levin, Lin, and Chu (LLC) Panel Unit Root (Stationarity) Test:**
- `ùëØ_ùüé`: Non-stationarity (unit root present).      
- `ùëØ_ùüè`: Stationarity.

**Results:** Overall statistic = -20.16 (p-value < 2.2e-16)

**Decision:** Reject the null hypothesis the variable is stationary (PCPIPCH rate series is stationary).

- We must use robust standard errors because :(Heteroskedasticity, Serial correlation, and Cross-sectional dependence).
- Lagged dependent variables must be included because: the series is stationary, which supports using a dynamic panel model like Difference GMM.

## **5.4. Two-Step Difference GMM (Arellano-bond)**

**Two-Step Difference GMM (Arellano‚ÄìBond):**

**Accounts for :**
- Endogeneity  (lagged inflation).
- Autocorrelation (by differencing and higher-order serial correlation)
- Heteroskedasticity( by a robust weighting matrix)
- Omitted variable bias (by differencing away unobserved fixed effects)
- Efficiency (via robust two-step weighting)

## **5.5. Diagnostic Tests for the GMM Model**

**Key Assumptions of the GMM Model:**
**A) Joint Significance of Coefficients (Wald Test):**

- `ùëØ_ùüé`: All slope coefficients are jointly zero. 
- `ùëØ_ùüè`: At least one coefficient is non-zero.

**Results:** œá¬≤ (7) = 660.07 (p-value < 0.001)

**Decision:** Reject the null hypothesis, the explanatory variables are jointly significant.

**B) Overidentifying Restrictions (Sargan Test ):**

- `ùëØ_ùüé`: All instruments are valid . 
- `ùëØ_ùüè`: At least one instrument is invalid.

**Results:** œá¬≤ = 11.86 (p-value = 0.457)

**Decision:** Fail to reject the null hypothesis, Instruments are valid.

**C) Arellano‚ÄìBond Test for First/ Second -Order Autocorrelation:**

- `ùëØ_ùüé`: No serial correlation.
- `ùëØ_ùüè`: Serial correlation exists.

**Results:** [AR (1)]: z = ‚àí0.99(p-value = 0.3199) & [AR (2)]: z = ‚àí0.58 (p-value = 0.5607)

**Decision:** Fail to reject null hypothesis , No serial correlation in the residuals. [AR (1)&(2)]

# **6. Conclusion**

**Model Comparison and Final Selection**

**After estimating and evaluating four model specifications‚ÄîPooled OLS, Fixed Effects, Random Effects, and Two-Step Difference GMM‚Äîwe summarize the findings:**

- Pooled OLS failed to account for country heterogeneity and produced biased estimates.
- Fixed Effects controlled unobserved heterogeneity but was inconsistent under endogeneity.
- Random Effects passed the Hausman test and provided a consistent structure but ignored dynamics and endogeneity.
- Difference GMM successfully addressed autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity, and endogeneity, and passed all diagnostic checks (Sargan, AR(1), AR(2)).

---

# **6. Recommendations and Future Work**

Based on the findings, it is recommended that applied macroeconomic research and policy forecasting in inflation contexts prioritize dynamic panel estimators‚Äîparticularly Two-Step Difference GMM‚Äîwhen dealing with persistent variables and potential endogeneity. 

**Future Work:**
-	Expansion of Dataset Coverage.
-	Inclusion of Energy Price Indices.
-	Extended Diagnostic Testing.
-	Development and Integration of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL).
